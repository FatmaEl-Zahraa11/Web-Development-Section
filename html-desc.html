        HTML (HyperText Markup Language): is the core language used to create the foundation of every website. 
        In this course, you will learn how to structure web pages using professional techniques. 
        You’ll understand how to organize text, images, videos, buttons, forms, and navigation menus using clean, semantic, and industry-standard HTML.
